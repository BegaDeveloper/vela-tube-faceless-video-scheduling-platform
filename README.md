## üíª My Role & Contributions

I worked as the **sole full-stack developer and architect**, responsible for building the entire **Vela-Tube system from scratch**, including the frontend, backend, AI integrations, and cloud deployment.

Key contributions:

* Designed and implemented the **end-to-end AI video generation flow**, integrating OpenAI APIs for scriptwriting, voice synthesis, and visual generation.
* Built the **Angular 18 frontend**, including dashboard, scheduling system, and video preview modules.
* Created **Express.js REST APIs** for handling video creation requests, progress tracking, and scheduling jobs.
* Integrated **MongoDB** for persistent storage of scripts, schedules, and user configurations.
* Connected **Google Cloud Storage and YouTube/TikTok APIs** for automated uploading and publishing.
* Implemented **task queues** to handle concurrent video generation and reduce response latency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Technical Highlights I Implemented

### üß© 1. End-to-End AI Video Generation Pipeline

I developed a fully automated **video creation engine**, capable of generating complete faceless videos from just a text prompt.

**Flow Overview:**

1. **Script Generation:**
   OpenAI GPT API generates a structured script with scenes, narration, and captions.
2. **Voiceover Creation:**
   Text-to-Speech service converts script sections into voice files.
3. **Visual Layer Composition:**
   DALL-E (or user-provided assets) generates scene images; FFmpeg stitches them with voiceovers.
4. **Subtitle Generation:**
   Captions generated from script text using Whisper for speech alignment.
5. **Final Assembly:**
   The backend merges all elements into a single MP4 file, uploaded to Google Cloud Storage.

This entire flow is orchestrated via Node‚Äôs async job queues and monitored via real-time status updates on the Angular dashboard.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Scheduling & Auto-Publishing System

Implemented a **cron-based scheduling engine** allowing users to queue multiple videos for future upload.

* Supports both **YouTube Data API** and **TikTok API**.
* Stores credentials securely in MongoDB with encrypted tokens.
* Handles **publish retries, queue prioritization, and upload progress** tracking.

On the Angular side, I built a **calendar-style UI** for managing upcoming posts, with real-time progress updates.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Dynamic Angular Dashboard

The Angular frontend provides a smooth content-creation and tracking experience:

* Built with **Angular Material** and **OnPush detection** for optimal performance.
* Integrated **RxJS streams** for live status updates (video generation, upload progress).
* Implemented **NgRx-style shared services** to maintain app state and session persistence.
* Developed a **video preview component** using HTML5 `<video>` elements bound to generated URLs.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Performance & Scalability Enhancements

* Optimized FFmpeg processing using **worker threads** for faster video rendering.
* Added **lazy-loading modules** in Angular to reduce bundle size.
* Cached AI responses and reused generated assets when possible to save tokens and time.
* Enabled **Google Cloud load balancing** for concurrent API calls during peak usage.

## üèÅ Outcome

Vela-Tube evolved into a **fully autonomous video content creation and scheduling platform**, allowing users to generate, edit, and publish faceless videos in minutes.
The combination of **Angular‚Äôs modern UI**, **Express.js orchestration**, and **OpenAI‚Äôs content generation** created a seamless, end-to-end automation tool for modern creators and marketers.

As the **sole developer**, I delivered a scalable SaaS-ready system capable of handling multiple concurrent AI jobs, automatic publishing, and full lifecycle management ‚Äî from prompt to post.
